      "One of the biggest challenges of designing a good classifier for solving a ***Statistical Pattern Classification*** problem is to estimate the underlying parameters to fit the model - given that the forms of the underlying probability distributions are known. The larger the number of parameters becomes, the more difficult it naturally is to estimate those parameters accurately (***Curse of Dimensionality***) from a limited number of training samples.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to avoid the ***Curse of Dimensionality***, pattern classification is often accompanied by ***Dimensionality Reduction***, which also has the nice side-effect of increasing the computational performance.\n",
      "Common techniques are projection-based, such as ***Principal Component Analysis (PCA)***, ***Linear Dimension Analysis (LDA)***, and ***Multivariate Dimension Analysis (MDA)***.  \n",
      "An alternative to the projection-based approach is the so-called ***Feature Selection***, and in this article, we will take a look at some of the established algorithms to tackle this combinatorial search problem. Note that those algorithms are considered as \"subpoptimal\" in contrast to an ***exhaustive search***, which is often computationally not feasible, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the goal of the presented ***sequential selection algorithms*** is to reduce the feature space *D = {x_1, x_2, x_n}* to a subset of features *D - n* in order to improve or optimize the **computational performance** of the classifier and to avoid the so-called ***Curse of Dimensionality***.  \n",
      "The goal is to select a \"sufficiently reduced\" subset from the feature space *D* \"without significantly reducing\" the performance of the classifier. In the process of choosing an \"optimal\" feature subset of size *k*, a so-called ***Criterion Function***, which typically, simply, and intuitively assesses the ***recognition rate*** of the classifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "F. Ferri, P. Pudil, M. Hatef, and J. Kittler investigated the performance of different ***Sequential Selection Algorithms*** for  ***Feature Selection*** on different scales and reported their results in a nice research article: *\"[Comparative Study of Techniques for Large Scale Feature Selection](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=02CB16CB1C28EA6CB57E212861CFB180?doi=10.1.1.24.4369&rep=rep1&type=pdf),\" Pattern Recognition in Practice IV, E.
