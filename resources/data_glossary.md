<a class="mk-toclify" id="curse-of-dimensionality"></a>
#### Curse of dimensionality
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

For a fixed number of training samples, the curse of dimensionality describes the increased error rate for a large number of dimensions (or features) due to imprecise parameter estimations.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="data-mining"></a>
#### Data mining
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A field that is closely related to machine learning and pattern classification. The focus of data mining is often on the collection of data and combines different techniques the data in order to extract meaningful information out of data.

<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="decision-rule"></a>
#### Decision rule
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A function in pattern classification tasks of making an "action", e.g., assigning a certain class label to an observation or pattern.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="feature-selection-algorithms"></a>
#### Feature Selection Algorithms
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Algorithmic approaches as alternative to projection-based techniques like Principal Component and Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction of a dataset via the selection a "sufficiently reduced" feature subsets with minimal decline of the recognition rate of a classifier.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="kernel-density-estimation"></a>
#### Kernel Density Estimation
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Non-parametric techniques to estimate probability densities from the available data without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying model of the probability distribution.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="k-means-clustering-1"></a>
#### K-Means Clustering
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A method of partitioning a dataset into *k* clusters by picking *k* random initial points (where *k* < *n*, the number or total points - modified by *S.R.*), assigning clusters, averaging, reassigning, and repeating until stability is achieved. The number *k* must be chosen beforehand.

<a class="mc-toclify" id="k-means-pp-clustering"></a>
#### K-Means++ Clustering
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A variant of [k-means](#k-means-clustering) where instead of choosing all initial centers randomly, the first is chosen randomly, the second chosen with probability proportional to the squared distance from the first, the third chosen with probability proportional to the square distance from the first two, etc. See [this paper](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/778/1/2006-13.pdf).

<a class="mc-toclify" id="Density-Based-clustering"></a>
#### Density Based Clustering
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

In density-based clustering, clusters are defined as areas of higher density which are separated by low density regions. The most popular density-based clustering method is DBSCAN [DBScan](#dbscan).

<a class="mc-toclify" id="dbscan"></a>
#### DBScan
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

DBScan is a [density-based clustering](#Density-Based-clustering) algorithm, which requires two paramaters $\eps$ and the minimum number of points required to form a dense region. Robustness of DBScan alogirthm in identifying clusters that are not linearly separable, as well as ability to handle clusters of different sizes have made it the most widely used clustering algorithm.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="linear-discriminant-analysis-lda"></a>
#### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A linear transformation technique (related to Principal Component Analysis) that is commonly used to project a dataset onto a new feature space or feature subspace, where the new component axes maximize the spread between multiple classes, or for classification of data.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="machine-learning"></a>
#### Machine learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A set of algorithmic instructions for discovering and learning patterns from data e.g., to train a classifier for a pattern classification task.


<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="maximum-likelihood-estimates-mle"></a>
#### Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A technique to estimate the parameters that have been fit to a model by maximizing a known likelihood function. One common application is the estimation of "mean" and "variance" for a Gaussian distribution.

<br>
<br>



<a class="mk-toclify" id="naive-bayes-classifier"></a>
#### Naive Bayes Classifier
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A classifier based on a statistical model (i.e., Bayes theorem: calculating posterior probabilities based on the prior probability and the so-called likelihood) in the field of pattern classification. It is based on the assumption that all features are i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed). 

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="objective-function"></a>
#### Objective function
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A function that is to be optimized (minimizing or maximizing a numerical value depending on a particular task or problem), for example, an objective function in pattern classification tasks could be to minimize the error rate of a classifier.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="normalization-min-max-scaling"></a>
#### Normalization - Min-Max scaling
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A data pre-processing step (also often referred to as "Feature Scaling") for fitting features from different measurements within a certain range, typically the unit range from 0 to 1.

<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="normalization-standard-scores"></a>
#### Normalization - Standard Scores
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A data pre-processing step (also often just called "Standardization") for re-scaling features from different measurements to match proportions of a standard normal distribution (unit variance centered at mean=0).

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="parzen-rosenblatt-window-technique"></a>
#### Parzen-Rosenblatt Window technique
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A non-parametric kernel density estimation technique for probability densities of random variables if the underlying distribution/model is unknown. A so-called window function is used to count samples within hypercubes or Gaussian kernels of a specified volume to estimate the probability density.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="pattern-classification"></a>

#### Pattern classification

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The usage of patterns in datasets to discriminate between classes, i.e., to assign a class label to a new observation based on inference.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="principal-component-analysis-pca"></a>
#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]


A linear transformation technique that is commonly used to project a given dataset onto a new feature space  or feature subspace (for dimensionality reduction) where the new component axes are the directions that maximize the variance/spread of the data.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="supervised-learning"></a>
#### Supervised Learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The problem of inferring a mapping between the input space X and a target variable y when given labelled training data (i.e. (X,y) pairs). Encompasses the problems of classification (categorical y) and regression (continuous y).

The problem of inferring latent structure in data when not given any training cases. Encompasses the problems of clustering, dimensionality reduction and density estimation.
